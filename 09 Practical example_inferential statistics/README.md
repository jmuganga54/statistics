Welcome to the second practical example, let me introduce you to the topic.

> Practical Problem

 You are a data analysis for `Al Bundy's` shoe shop. `Al Bundy's` is a U.S based company established 30 years ago. It also operates in Canada the UK, and Germany.

 The firm selles mid to high end shoes, ranging from 120 to 200 dollars while the shoes are of high quality. You have a lot of inventory never sold. The shoes collect dust on store shelves.

 Inventory management is the common problem. Many if not most shops cannot determine the right number of itmems they need to keep in stock. 
 
 The opposite problem arises too. Shop's don't supply an adequate ammount of goods and fail to meet the demand in their market. For instance, you have surely entered a shoe shop but could not buy a specific pair of shoes because they did not have them in stock.


In this example, we will examine the opposite problem. Having too much inventory. This is  a more significant problem for the company as it means the company has inversted in producing or purchasing the product but could not sell it.

One way to solve this problem is by using confidence intervals.
