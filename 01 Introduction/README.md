## Topic
This course will be tought by Illya and he will be taking us through statistics for data science and business analysis.

 First we will start with the very basics we will learn about the different types of data and we will distinguish between `population` and `sample data`

 We will study the level of measurement we can use the difference between `categorical` and `numerical` variables how to plot data, how to measure `mean`, `median` ,`mode` and how to `quantify variability`.

 Once we have covered the introductory part of the course we will be ready to learn about the `Central Limit Theorem`,  `Normal Distribution`,  `Student's t distribution` and how to create use and interpret `confidence intervals`. These are some of the indispensable tools you need when making business decision relying on `data`.

 You must be able to make predictions under uncertainty and that's precisely what you can do, after completing this part of the course then we will move on to `hypothesis testing` which is at the `heart of decision making`. Each data driven decision comes after a hypothesis test.

You will learn how to formulate a hypothesis and act according to the result.

In the fourth part of the course we will dive into the world of `regression analysis`. Regression analysis is a powerful tool that allows us to build predictive models based on causal relationships.

Specifically we will concentrate on the `OLS`. the most widely used framework for statistical regression.
